This code repository contains solutions to the "Transpilation: Generating Efficient Hardware-Compliant Quantum Circuits" lab from the Qiskit Global Summer School 2024. The Qiskit Global Summer School is a two-week intensive summer program designed to empower quantum researchers and developers with the skills to explore quantum computing. The lab focuses on transpiling quantum circuits to run efficiently on real quantum hardware. Transpilation is the process of converting a quantum circuit into an equivalent circuit that can be executed on a specific quantum device. This is an important step in running quantum algorithms on actual quantum computers.
